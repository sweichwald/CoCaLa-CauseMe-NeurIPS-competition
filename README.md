This repository contains pretty cool stuff!

We, the team of the [Copenhagen Causality Lab (CoCaLa)](https://www.math.ku.dk/english/research/spt/cocala/) participating in the [Causality 4 Climate NeurIPS competition](https://causeme.uv.es/neurips2019/), are posting the scripts here that generated our final competition submissions.

No documentation (yet) and (partly) unpolished as we posted this right after the competition closed ;-)
